INFO:Security:56 - Part 'xc6slx150' is not a WebPack part.
WARNING:Security:42 - Your software subscription period has lapsed. Your current version of Xilinx tools will continue
to function, but you no longer qualify for Xilinx software updates or new releases.

Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range: 0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
Initializing voltage to 1.140 Volts. (default - Range: 1.140 to 1.260 Volts)

INFO:Par:282 - No user timing constraints were detected or you have set the option to ignore timing constraints ("par
   -x"). Place and Route will run in "Performance Evaluation Mode" to automatically improve the performance of all
   internal clocks in this design. Because there are not defined timing requirements, a timing score will not be
   reported in the PAR report in this mode. The PAR timing summary will list the performance achieved for each clock.
   Note: For the fastest runtime, set the effort level to "std".  For best performance, set the effort level to "high".

Device speed data version:  "PRODUCTION 1.23 2013-10-13".

  Number of MUXCYs used:                         0 out of  46,076    0%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:            1
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:             0 out of       1    0%

      to control set restrictions:               0 out of 184,304    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
